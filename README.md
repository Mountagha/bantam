# bantam
**Bantam** is a tiny little language used to demonstrate Pratt parsing from [this blog post of Bob Nystrom](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/).<br/>  
I ported the toy language to Python since the blog post uses Java and not everyone including me (*sarcasm*) is fan the latter.<br />  
I tried to make it look as much as possible to the original implementation from [the original repository](https://github.com/munificent/bantam).<br /> 
To run tests you need to install [pytest library](https://pytest.org) and run the following command from the root of the cloned repository. <br />  
  ` pytest main.py `
